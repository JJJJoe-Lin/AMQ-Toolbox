Download audio/video file of the question. You can use auto download to download each song you met.

Customized buttons for answering quickly.

## [AMQ Force Skip (amqForceSkip.user.js)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JJJJoe-Lin/AMQ-Toolbox/master/amqForceSkip.user.js)
Force skip the answer phase without waiting buffering. Notice: you may not hear the next song where loading is not completed.

## [AMQ No Avatar Snipe (amqNoAvatarSkip.user.js)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JJJJoe-Lin/AMQ-Toolbox/master/amqNoAvatarSnipe.user.js)
Players' avatar wouldn't change when they answered so you can't snipe by that. Notice: other scripts may change this behavior.
